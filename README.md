# SPy memory model simulation

Playground for experimenting with different design of memory models for SPy.

- `spyruntime.py`: this represent the core functionality offered by the SPy interpreter:
  builtin types, `@blue_generic` decorator, a simulation of the heap, etc.

- `model.py`: this is code which in real world will be implemented in `*.spy` files


Moreover, `PLAN.spy` contains a pseudocode version of them, probably easier to follow.
